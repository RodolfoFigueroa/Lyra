# Contributing to Lyra

This repository is a uv workspace containing the FastAPI application and three
public Python packages. Product documentation lives in `docs/` and is part of
the same change contract as code.

## Repository map

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `lyra_app/` | HTTP routes, configuration, plugin catalog, job store, workers, MCP, and deployment runtime. |
| `packages/lyra_sdk/` | Public plugin, catalog, geometry, job, and runtime contracts. |
| `packages/lyra_api/` | HTTP clients and the administrative CLI. |
| `packages/lyra_utils/` | Optional geospatial, date, and Earth Engine helpers. |
| `examples/lyra-plugin/` | Executable plugin used by the docs and integration tests. |
| `skills/lyra-metric/` | Portable agent instructions and bundled references for adapting workflows into metrics. |
| `tests/` | Unit, contract, route, client, worker, and documentation tests. |
| `docs/` | Astro Starlight site and generated-reference tooling. |

Start route changes in `lyra_app/routes/`, manifest changes in
`packages/lyra_sdk/src/lyra/sdk/`, worker behavior in `lyra_app/worker.py`, and
client behavior in `packages/lyra_api/src/lyra/api/client/`.

## Environment

Use uv for Python environment and package management:

```bash
uv sync
```

For direct processes, provide `/lyra_data/config/lyra.toml`, the Earth Engine
service-account file, `LYRA_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and both API keys. Install selected
plugins in the process environment. API and workers can start independently:

```bash
uv run python -m lyra_app.main
uv run python -m lyra_app.worker_launcher interactive
```

The development Compose stack is the preferred integration environment:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
```

For editable plugin development, dependency changes, and multiple plugin checkouts,
see [the deployment example](examples/lyra-deployment/README.md). Source edits need
a manual process restart; contract edits also need manifest regeneration.

## Required verification

After changing Python, run all of these and fix failures caused by the change:

```bash
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
uv run ty check
uv run pytest \
  --cov=lyra_app \
  --cov=lyra \
  --cov-report=term-missing \
  --cov-report=xml
```

For a focused iteration, run the affected test file first, then run the full
suite before handoff. Do not weaken lint, type, or coverage rules to make a
change pass.

Validate documentation with:

```bash
npm ci --prefix docs
npm run generate --prefix docs
npm run check --prefix docs
npm run build --prefix docs
```

Generated reference files are ignored. Change source types, docstrings,
configuration metadata, parsers, MCP contracts, or authored guides instead of
editing generated Markdown or JSON.

Each guide declares its `contentType` and `contentPlan` in frontmatter. Keep its
goal, audience, and section outline current in `docs/content-plan.json`; sidebar
labels can use title case independently of sentence case page headings. When
splitting a runnable Python example across snippets, give every piece the same
filename title and update the documentation contract tests to execute them in order.

## Change discipline

- Keep API catalog behavior separate from worker code execution. API processes
  read installed manifests; workers import trusted plugin code.
- Update SDK models, routes, clients, tests, and docs together when a public
  contract changes.
- Keep one authoritative example or explanation and link to it elsewhere.
- When SDK authoring contracts change, review `skills/lyra-metric/`, its bundled
  reference, compatibility helper and tests, documented contract revision, and
  the agent-assisted authoring guide in the same change.
  Unit vocabulary changes require reviewing the SDK enum, authoring unit tables,
  generated schemas, and skill compatibility checks together. Keep essential
  guidance usable outside this checkout. Review and rerun
  the [skill evaluations](tests/fixtures/skill_workflows/scenarios/README.md)
  for calculation preservation, plugin extension, missing
  information, contract conflicts, and file outputs; check that ambiguous cases
  produce questions before dependent implementation. Behavioral trials provide
  evidence of compliance, not a mechanical guarantee.
- Use Conventional Commit titles. Release Please versions the application,
  SDK, API client (including the CLI), and utilities independently.
- Documentation deploys on pushes to `main`, product releases, and manual runs.
  Latest (`main`) lives at `/Lyra/latest/` and may include unreleased changes.
  Product release tags (`lyra-vX.Y.Z`) define snapshots at
  `/Lyra/versions/<version>/`; the site root opens the newest release.
  Historical `lyra-app-vX.Y.Z` tags remain valid documentation sources.
  Package-only tags do not publish a new documentation site.

## Releases

Merges to `main` feed Release Please. It maintains one aggregate release PR,
while each package keeps its own version. Ordinary contributors only need to
use a Conventional Commit PR title; they do not create tags or edit release
metadata by hand.

For maintainers, the release workflow is:

1. Review the bot's aggregate release PR. Confirm the proposed product and
   package versions, changelog entries, lockfile, and required CI checks.
2. Keep the PR open while more changes accumulate, or merge it when the product
   is ready to ship. The product version always advances when any package ships.
3. After merge, automation rebuilds and smoke-tests every distribution from the
   immutable merge commit. If validation succeeds, it creates tags only for
   changed packages, publishes the versioned and `latest` container images, then
   creates one GitHub Release named `Lyra vX.Y.Z` with a machine-readable
   component manifest attached.
4. The published product release triggers documentation validation and deployment.

CI checks the committed lockfile; the release-lock bot commits any required
refresh to the release PR. Python checks verify SDK generation and publish
coverage artifacts. Release publication requires Python, packaging, and docs
checks. Documentation publishing requires only docs checks and reuses cached
release builds; cache misses rebuild from tags. Only main participates in CI/CD.

The release publisher is intentionally ordered so no tag, image, or GitHub
Release is created before validation passes. Its tag and release operations are
idempotent: a failed run can be retried from GitHub Actions. If an existing tag
points at a different commit, the run stops for manual investigation instead of
moving the tag. Do not manually merge a second release PR or create release tags
while a publication run is active.

If Release Please reports `There are untagged, merged release PRs outstanding`,
check merged PRs carrying `autorelease: pending` and their publication runs.
Retry a failed publisher before starting another release. If a maintainer chooses
to supersede an unpublished release instead, remove its pending label and rerun
Release Please; do not mark it `autorelease: tagged` or invent release tags.
The configured `bootstrap-sha` is the last published release before the skipped
v0.19.0 release. It bounds history scanning when a manifest version has no tag;
normal tag-based discovery resumes once the replacement release is published.

The repository secret `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` must be able to update release PRs,
push tags, create releases, and edit PR labels. GitHub's package token publishes
the container image. Component distributions are currently build artifacts and
tags only; this pipeline does not publish them to PyPI.

Use `fix` for patch changes, `feat` for minor changes, and `!` or a
`BREAKING CHANGE` footer for breaking changes. Below 1.0, breaking changes
advance the minor version.


Main pushes validate each commit once. Release publication consumes those same
checks and the validated Latest artifact, then deploys documentation after the
release completes. Ordinary documentation deployments depend only on docs checks.
PR checks remain separate. Rerun failed jobs to resume a publication.

Archived documentation uses the assembler's `ARCHIVE_RECIPE_VERSION`. Bump it
when changing historical rendering, fixing archive builds, or intentionally
rebuilding archives with a changed toolchain. Routine dependency updates do not
invalidate archives. Missing caches rebuild from release tags.
