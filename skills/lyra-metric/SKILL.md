# Adapt a workflow to Lyra

Produce a locally validated plugin around the user's existing calculation. Keep
the calculation independent of Lyra and introduce a small adapter. Read
[the authoring reference](references/authoring.md) before implementing the adapter.
It includes a complete example and the supported SDK contract; no Lyra repository
checkout is required.

## Establish the contract before coding

Inspect the target repository's instructions, calculation, documentation, tests,
dependency declarations, and existing plugin factory. Determine whether the user
wants a new plugin or a metric added to the existing one. Preserve existing
registrations, package layout, build backend, and unrelated configuration.

Use the bundled reference as the authoring contract. Before implementing, run
`uv run python <skill-directory>/scripts/check_compatibility.py` from the target
project, replacing `<skill-directory>` with this installed skill's directory.
Execute the helper without reading its source into context. It reports the SDK
version and checks the **lyra-authoring** baseline, including local node manifests.
A passing check permits authoring; it does not replace validation of the adapter.
SDK versions are diagnostic information, not a release allowlist. The helper also
checks the documented unit vocabulary and explicit null-unit behavior.

On failure, use the concise diagnostic and relevant version-matched documentation
to resolve the specific issue. Read a narrowly targeted SDK implementation only
when a concrete error or contradiction remains unresolved. Do not routinely read
installed Lyra source or dump complete schemas to learn the contract. Ask about
unresolved incompatibilities; do not upgrade dependencies automatically. If the
helper cannot run, report the blocked check and continue only independent work.

Use the platform facts in the reference before asking the user: `location` contains Polygon/MultiPolygon features; `bounds` contains exactly one Polygon. Both declare a coordinate reference system (CRS). Workers initialize Earth Engine before loading plugins when the deployment configuration includes `[earth_engine]`.

Use these integration facts when adapting metrics. Establish any narrower workflow requirements from its implementation, tests, or documentation.

Trace ordinary parameters, spatial requirements, returned values, and external
data or services through the implementation and tests. Establish which facts are
documented, demonstrated, missing, or contradictory. A type annotation or a
successful sample run alone does not establish scientific meaning or validity
across regions and scales.

## Ask rather than guess

Ask the user when missing or conflicting information requires a decision that
affects the calculation, its public contract, or interpretation of results.
First consult the bundled platform contract and inspect workflow evidence.
The following are subjects to investigate, not a questionnaire to ask verbatim:

- Parameter meanings, defaults, valid ranges, and list semantics.
- CRS and reprojection requirements, geometry types, required zone attributes,
  geographic coverage, and valid spatial scales.
- Output meanings, units, column types, nullability, and the correspondence
  between returned rows and input features.
- Required datasets, credentials, services, and intended handling of missing data.

Use the reference's spatial-input and Earth Engine initialization contracts
without asking the user to reconfirm these platform facts.
Keep existing reprojection to EPSG:4326 without asking the user to reconfirm code
that already establishes it. Do not add a restriction requiring incoming geometry
to already be EPSG:4326 when the workflow handles reprojection.

Separate the size or administrative level of an input region from the raster
resolution used in a calculation. Inspect the chosen datasets and any available
matching documentation for actual limitations. Missing documentation of geographic
coverage or valid region sizes does not by itself require a new restriction or
block the adapter or warrant a generic disclaimer in metric metadata. Do not
claim universal coverage or scientific validity at all scales. Report incomplete
validation in the handoff, and keep known consumer-relevant limitations in metadata.
Ask if a concrete decision remains, such as choosing an unspecified reduction resolution or deciding
how to handle regions without source data. Continue otherwise.

Read available evidence first, but do not silently resolve contradictions between
code, documentation, tests, and user requirements. Explain the conflict and ask.
Do not invent plausible units, descriptions, ranges, defaults, or validation rules
to satisfy Lyra's metadata requirements. Do not replace an unknown unit with
"dimensionless" or an unknown meaning with a generic label.

Group related questions concisely. Say what is unknown and why the answer matters;
cite the relevant code or documentation when available. Suggested choices are
proposals, not decisions. Wait for answers before implementing dependent behavior.
Silence is not confirmation. Continue independent work only where it does not
embed the unresolved choice; do not register a guessed or placeholder contract.
If questions cannot be delivered interactively, report them and leave the
dependent work incomplete.

Routine private helper names and layout choices can follow repository conventions.
Public names should follow the user's terminology and existing project conventions;
ask when their meaning is ambiguous. Obtain agreement before changing the
calculation's scientific or computational semantics. Never silently drop rows,
fill missing results, relabel rows by position, or impose arbitrary output columns.

## Implement the smallest adapter

1. Preserve the existing callable and its defaults. Put ordinary inputs in a
   compatible parameter model, and use the SDK's resolved spatial arguments.
   Convert geometry for the existing callable without changing its CRS or
   attributes unless the workflow explicitly requires that transformation.
2. Declare the evidenced output contract. Select output units from the reference
   using `Unit`; explicitly use `None` only when no unit applies. Ask when a unit
   is unknown or unavailable, and explain workflow-defined score scales in column
   descriptions. Never substitute a generic unit to bypass missing information.
   Table columns are fixed; if the
   calculation produces parameter-dependent columns, ask for a stable declared
   schema. Preserve producer-owned row identities; only ask for a mapping when
   the calculation actually needs one. Publish native tables. Use the job temporary
   directory for internal scratch work. Unsupported async or generator workflows need
   an agreed adaptation, not a silent algorithm rewrite.
   Include evidenced details in metric, parameter, and column descriptions only
   when they help consumers select the metric, choose inputs, or interpret results
   without its README. Methodology topics are possibilities, not required fields.
   Follow the reference's [description guidance](references/authoring.md#descriptions-for-independent-consumers);
   source links supplement the explanation rather than replace it.
3. Put external acquisition in dataset nodes, including source reads hidden in
   calculation helpers. Declare table dependencies for metrics and register all
   nodes. Preserve scientific behavior while making acquisition explicit.
   Consumers copy supplied tables before mutation.
   Register the adapter in the plugin factory. For a new project, provide package
   metadata and manifest packaging configuration. For an existing project,
   extend its factory and configuration without replacing other metrics.
4. Declare directly imported dependencies using the repository's dependency
   policy. Use `uv` for Python environment and command management. Ask before
   adding runtime dependencies unless the user has authorized them; explain what
   each adds and whether existing dependencies suffice. Do not presume packages
   are available from a public index: use the project's configured package source
   or ask for the intended source.
   For Earth Engine workflows, use the runtime's initialized environment without
   adding authentication, credential discovery, project-ID parameters, or imports
   from `lyra_app`. Keep imports and factories usable without Earth Engine
   initialization; create initialization-dependent objects during execution.
   Preserve standalone initialization in a separate script or test harness when
   needed, rather than invoking it from plugin imports or handlers.
5. Generate `lyra.plugin.json` with `lyra-plugin build-manifest`; never author or
   patch its schema manually. Include installation metadata, but do not publish,
   deploy, commit, or install into a user's agent configuration as part of authoring
   unless separately requested.

## Verify and hand off

Compare the adapted calculation with the original on a small, representative
fixture. Test multiple features with distinct values and nontrivial identifiers
so swapped rows cannot pass accidentally. Exercise parameter preparation when a
parameter model is declared, and result normalization, not just direct function
calls. Verify invalid parameters,
output names, native table types, empty results, public encoding, and any
workflow-specific row relationships. Use fake acquisition to exercise dependencies.
When extending
a plugin, verify existing metrics remain registered and retain their behavior.

Run manifest generation, inspection, and freshness checks, plus the repository's
required formatting, linting, type checking, and tests. Use the existing project
environment. Do not perform wheel or package-installation smoke checks unless
requested. Do not start production jobs or expensive data retrieval to validate
an adapter without authorization. Local SDK validation does not require platform
services; the underlying workflow may require them.

Review the generated manifest and `lyra-plugin describe` without relying on the
README. Can a consumer select the metric, supply meaningful inputs, and interpret
its results and limitations? Compare the metadata with the workflow evidence;
restore omitted consequential details, remove details that do not affect consumer
decisions, and resolve contradictions before handoff. Keep implementation inventories
and generic validation caveats out of descriptions.
This is a semantic review, not a description-length check.

If data, tools, or services are unavailable, report the exact blocked check and
what is still unverified. Do not fabricate fixtures with scientific assumptions
or describe a mocked calculation as validated against real data.

Finish with the changed files, established contract, tests and their outcomes,
remaining questions or limitations, and an example request using known valid
inputs. Distinguish a locally validated plugin from deployment verification.
