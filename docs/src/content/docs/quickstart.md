description: Configure and start Lyra, then submit one authenticated job.
---

This path starts the API, Redis, and two worker pools with Docker Compose. Lyra
does not bundle spatial data or credentials.

## Prerequisites

Provide:

- Docker with Compose;
- a reachable PostGIS database containing Lyra's census and metropolitan-zone
  tables;
- a Google Earth Engine project and readable service-account JSON;
- one random agent key and a different random admin key.

## Configure

From the repository root:

```bash
mkdir -p lyra_data/config secrets
cp config.example.toml lyra_data/config/lyra.toml
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `lyra_data/config/lyra.toml` and set the Earth Engine project and `[database]` host, port, name, and user. Its checked-in
defaults target the development Compose Redis service and use
`http://localhost:5219` as the public API URL.

Put the service-account JSON at `secrets/service-account.json`. Edit `.env` with
`LYRA_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and two different API secrets:

```text
LYRA_AGENT_API_KEY=replace-with-a-random-agent-secret
LYRA_ADMIN_API_KEY=replace-with-a-different-admin-secret
```

## Start

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
```

Wait for readiness:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5219/live
curl http://localhost:5219/ready
```

`/live` only proves the API process is running. `/ready` returns `200` only when
Redis and PostGIS are reachable and the plugin catalog initialized successfully.

## Configure plugins

Enable the plugin included in the development image before startup:

```toml
[[plugins.installed]]
distribution = "lyra-smoke-plugin"
manifest_path = "/workspace/lyra/examples/lyra-plugin/lyra.plugin.json"
```

The development image installs the example plugin editably and mounts its source
into every process. After implementation edits, restart the workers. After contract
edits, regenerate the manifest and restart the API and workers. Dependency changes
require updating the deployment lockfiles and rebuilding the image. For production
images and additional plugins, see [Deployment](../operate/deployment/).

Validate with `uv run lyra-admin config validate lyra_data/config/lyra.toml`.
After editing a running deployment, follow the [drain and restart procedure](../operate/deployment/#updates).
No admin API registration is needed.

## Submit a job

Discover the live contract instead of copying an arbitrary metric payload:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5219/metrics
curl http://localhost:5219/metrics/METRIC_NAME
```

For the configured example plugin, submit `smoke_table_metric` with nested
parameters. For another metric, use its advertised schema. A declared parameter
model requires `parameters` even when its value is `{}`; omit that property for
parameterless metrics. Each submission creates a new job. If submission times out, another request may duplicate it:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5219/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${LYRA_AGENT_API_KEY}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"metric":"smoke_table_metric","input":{"location":{"data_type":"met_zone_code","value":"09.01"},"parameters":{"value":7}}}'
```

Use the returned `job_id` to poll status and read the terminal descriptor:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5219/jobs/JOB_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${LYRA_AGENT_API_KEY}"

curl http://localhost:5219/jobs/JOB_ID/result/descriptor \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${LYRA_AGENT_API_KEY}"
```

Results expire. Download the complete named-output JSON result before the descriptor's
lifetime reaches zero.
