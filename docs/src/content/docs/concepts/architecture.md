description: Understand catalog discovery, authenticated submission, and warm worker execution.

Lyra separates public contracts from trusted execution.

## Catalog path

1. The deployment image installs Lyra and its plugins from a locked dependency set.
2. Operators select installed distributions and queue assignments in `lyra.toml`.
3. At startup the API reads installed node manifests without importing plugin code.
4. The registry validates the generated request schemas and spatial metadata
   directly; there is no second compiled manifest.
5. `/metrics` publishes only client-facing names, descriptions, schemas, spatial
   mappings, outputs, and a contract fingerprint.

The public fingerprint excludes distribution names, factories, queues, and job
state.

API and workers independently validate installed distribution versions and manifests.
Workers import factories for their public roots and all transitive dependencies and compare the live
definitions with those manifests. They can start before the API. No shared catalog
files or runtime package installation are needed.

## Job path

1. An authenticated caller submits a metric and input.
2. The API validates the current metric schema and resolves spatial wrappers.
3. It captures unresolved provenance and the metric contract in native RQ metadata,
   then enqueues resolved JSON inputs on the assigned queue.
4. A warm worker parses the envelope through the imported `PluginDefinition`,
   executes the graph sequentially, resolving parameters and dependencies before
   each node. Dataset contexts provide acquisition services; metrics receive
   their declared tables and operational context.
5. The worker verifies the submitted identity and contract, validates native
   named DataFrame/GeoDataFrame returns through the SDK, and returns the result to RQ.
   RQ owns execution, heartbeats, failure detection, and result retention.
6. Clients poll status, inspect descriptors, and download retained
   output.

## Components

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| FastAPI application | Discovery, validation, resolution, submission, result access, and administration. |
| `lyra-sdk` | Shared plugin, geometry, catalog, job, and runtime contracts. |
| `lyra-api` | Sync and async HTTP clients. |
| RQ workers | Trusted plugin import, execution, and result validation. |
| Redis | Native RQ queues, registries, job metadata, and retained results. |
| PostGIS | Readiness and database-backed spatial resolution. |
| MCP adapter | Strict agent tools over the same submission and result services. |

API and worker processes deliberately have different trust boundaries. A valid
catalog entry proves a manifest is readable; it does not prove a worker can
import or execute the plugin.

The API owns one database runtime, starts it during application lifespan, and
closes it during shutdown or startup failure. REST dependencies and the in-process
MCP backend receive that same runtime explicitly. Spatial resolution uses its
bounded executor and an engine-bound converter map; there is no global converter
fallback. Explicit GeoJSON inputs follow this execution path without opening a
database connection. Tests that construct applications or submit jobs directly
must supply the runtime; standalone MCP transport tests supply a backend.
