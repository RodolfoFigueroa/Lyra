title: Python Client
description: Inspect the catalog and submit metric jobs with synchronous or asynchronous clients.
---

Install `lyra-api` and use `LyraClient` or `AsyncLyraClient` to inspect the
catalog, submit dictionary arguments, and retrieve typed job results:

```bash
uv add lyra-api
```

Client classes, job handles, options, exceptions, and `parse_result_ref` are
conveniently available from `lyra.api`. The [Python reference](../../api/lyra/)
documents each definition in its owning module. Import SDK models from their
owning modules, such as `lyra.sdk.models.job` and `lyra.sdk.models.spatial`.

## Inspect the catalog

```python
import os

from lyra.api import LyraClient

client = LyraClient(
    "lyra.example.com",
    agent_api_key=os.environ["LYRA_AGENT_API_KEY"],
)

catalog = client.catalog.metrics()
for metric in catalog.metrics:
    print(metric.name, metric.description)

# Use a metric name advertised by your deployment.
metric = client.catalog.metric("smoke_table_metric")
print(metric.request_schema)
print(metric.outputs)
```

The catalog exposes each metric's request schema, spatial inputs, and output
contract, together with a schema dialect, contract version, and catalog
fingerprint. Choose argument names and values from the deployed metric's schema.

## Submit, wait, and retrieve results

The following examples assume the deployment has the example plugin configured. Its `smoke_table_metric` accepts
a location and a required integer `value` inside `parameters`.

```python
from lyra.sdk.types import JsonObject

arguments: JsonObject = {
    "location": {"data_type": "met_zone_code", "value": "09.01"},
    "parameters": {"value": 7},
}
handle = client.raw.submit(
    "smoke_table_metric",
    arguments,
)
print(handle.job_id, handle.status().status)
result = handle.wait(timeout=300)

print(result.outputs)
client.results.download(handle.job_id, "result.json")
```

A declared parameter model requires the `parameters` object, even if all fields
have defaults and the object is empty. For parameterless metrics such as
`smoke_summary_metric`, omit `parameters`. Defaults are applied in the worker; Python
semantic validators can fail an accepted job with `invalid_input`.

`submit()` returns a `JobHandle`. Its `wait()` method polls status until
completion and returns the successful
named table result. Once the job is complete, `handle.result()` fetches its
result again. Failed jobs raise `MetricRunError` through these
handle methods, with the job ID, status, structured error, and terminal result.
A wait deadline raises `JobWaitTimeoutError`; the job can still be running.

For a saved job ID, use `client.jobs.get(job_id)` to inspect status,
`client.results.get(job_id)` to fetch any terminal result, and
`client.results.descriptor(job_id)` for result metadata. Descriptor and download
operations also accept stable `lyra://results/{job_id}` references.

Retrieve native tables by output name with either method:

```python
tables = client.result_tables(handle.job_id)
# Equivalent: client.results.tables("lyra://results/" + handle.job_id)
# For example_population_baseline:
# areas = tables["example_population_areas"]
# total = tables["example_population_total"]
```

Both methods return a dictionary, including for a single output. Records become
Pandas DataFrames; GeoJSON outputs become GeoPandas GeoDataFrames in WGS84.
Empty tables retain declared columns, including the active geometry column for
spatial outputs. Row order and explicit identifier columns are preserved. Native
indices and dtypes are not restored; dates remain ISO strings and missing values
use Pandas' inferred representation. Failed jobs raise `MetricRunError`.

To submit and wait in one call:

```python
from lyra.api import RunOptions

result = client.raw.run(
    "smoke_table_metric",
    arguments,
    options=RunOptions(timeout=300),
)
```

To save the complete JSON result, `client.raw.run_to_file(metric_name,
arguments, path="result.json", options=RunOptions(timeout=300))` also downloads
the successful result.

## Asynchronous use

```python
import os

from lyra.api import AsyncLyraClient

client = AsyncLyraClient(
    "lyra.example.com",
    agent_api_key=os.environ["LYRA_AGENT_API_KEY"],
)
catalog = await client.catalog.metrics()
handle = await client.raw.submit(
    "smoke_table_metric",
    {
        "location": {"data_type": "met_zone_code", "value": "09.01"},
        "parameters": {"value": 7},
    },
)
result = await handle.wait(timeout=300)
tables = await client.result_tables(handle.job_id)
# Equivalent: await client.results.tables(handle.job_id)
```

Await asynchronous catalog, submission, result, and download operations. An
`AsyncJobHandle` provides `status()`, `result()`, and `wait()` as awaitable
operations.

## Errors and polling

Both clients raise `DownloadError` for transport failures, unexpected HTTP
statuses, malformed JSON, and responses that do not match the expected model.
The message identifies the operation; parsing, validation, and transport errors
retain their original exception as the cause. Ordinary requests, including job
submission, are never retried automatically.

An unexpected HTTP 503 with structured service details raises
`ServiceUnavailableError`. Its `code`, `retryable`, and `retry_after_seconds`
attributes provide retry guidance. `Retry-After` accepts nonnegative seconds
or an HTTP date; absent or invalid guidance produces `None`. Unstructured or malformed 503 responses raise `DownloadError`.
`health.readiness()` accepts both HTTP 200 and HTTP 503 and returns the validated
readiness response.

`wait()` polls immediately, then every five seconds with ±10% jitter. Pass a
positive finite `poll_interval` to `wait()` or `RunOptions` to change the cadence.
`timeout=None` waits indefinitely; zero expires immediately. Finite monotonic
deadlines bound observations, retries, sleeps, and terminal-result retrieval.
Individual requests remain bounded by the client's request timeout even with
unlimited overall waiting. Deadline enforcement cannot preempt arbitrary user
callbacks or synchronous CPU processing; it bounds network observation and
scheduled waiting. Timing out, interrupting a synchronous wait, or cancelling an
async wait never cancels the remote job.

Waiting retries connection failures, timeouts, and HTTP 429/500/502/503/504 up to
five consecutive times, resetting after a successful response. Backoff starts
at one second and doubles up to 30 seconds with jitter. Valid `Retry-After`
guidance takes precedence. Explicitly non-retryable service errors,
authentication failures, other client errors, invalid payloads, and certificate
or configuration errors fail immediately. Exhaustion raises `JobPollingError`;
deadline expiry raises `JobWaitTimeoutError`, both with job context. Missing
jobs or results fail explicitly and never trigger resubmission.

`on_progress` receives the first available `JobProgress` snapshot and subsequent
content changes, ignoring timestamp-only changes. Async handles await callbacks
that return awaitables. Callback exceptions propagate unchanged.

`results.download(ref, path)` streams the complete JSON job-result envelope,
including named outputs, their declarations, and request provenance. Downloads
validate HTTP errors before opening the destination.

## Validation and migration

Metric-specific client generation has been removed. Metric-specific
autocomplete, generated request models, local generated-client validation, and
automatic catalog compatibility checks are no longer available. Pass JSON
objects to the regular client's `raw` methods. Server-side validation remains
authoritative and validates submissions against each metric's request schema.
The catalog endpoints, schemas, and fingerprints remain available for inspection.

## Authentication and administrator clients

Pass a hostname without a URL scheme. HTTPS is enabled by default; for a local
HTTP deployment use `LyraClient("localhost:8000", secure=False, ...)`.
Consumer job operations use `agent_api_key`; public catalog and lookup endpoints
do not require that credential. Keep credentials in environment variables.

Operator applications use a separate client type and administrator credential:

```python
import os

from lyra.api import LyraAdminClient

admin = LyraAdminClient(
    "lyra.example.com",
    admin_api_key=os.environ["LYRA_ADMIN_API_KEY"],
)
status = admin.status()
jobs = admin.jobs.list(status="running")
workers = admin.workers.list()
```

Use `AsyncLyraAdminClient` for the equivalent asynchronous interface. Both
administrator clients expose `health`, `jobs`, `plugins`, `catalog`,
`workers`, `queues`, and `routing`. Consumer and administrator credentials are
accepted by their respective client types.
